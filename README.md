# Comic Buddy App (OOP)

In the Comic Buddy App you will find a form to input your favorite super hero's name, the universe they belong to and their super hero power.

I created this app focused mainly on Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

If you open your inspector tool and view your local storage you will see that when you enter a new super hero that data get saved to the local storage. When you delete a super hero from list that data also gets deleted from the local storage.
